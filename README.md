# Block-Logic
Idea for the game was inspired by a google game ad I saw a while back on my phone


# Game includes:

Main Menu

Pause Menu

High score

GDD



# Controls

Left click to select blocks

S to show solution

Esc to play if in solution state

Esc to pause if in play state



# How to Play:

Left click to select a box you think is to be filled.

Blue - Correct!

Red - Wrong :(

Each row and coloum have a number next to them, this means how many blocks in that row/coloumn are to be filled. For example, a row has the numbers "1 3" next to it. This means that in that row there are 2 sets of blocks, 1 set of 1 block and another set of 3 blocks. There must be a dstance of at least 1 white block between each set of blocks. You get a max of 3 wrong tries before your score resets.
